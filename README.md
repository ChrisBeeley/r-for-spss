## This is a one day workshop aimed at teaching SPSS users how to use R.

I run it within the NHS but I imagine it could be run in other organisations without any alterations.

Do note that all the data in this repository is either made up (in the case of Dummy_SPSS.sav) or freely available online (all other datasets).

Remix/ reuse for non/ commercial/ whatever.

The first session was a success but I had a lot of feedback about the end about tweaking the content and to be honest I'm not even sure the material is presented in the correct order. I'm releasing it now because somebody asked and intend to make it better over the coming months (there is another session planned in June, so before then).
